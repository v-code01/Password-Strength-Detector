Password Strength Detector

## Overview

The Password Strength Detector is a cutting-edge Python library designed to provide an unparalleled level of security in evaluating the strength of passwords. Leveraging advanced mathematical concepts, cryptographic techniques, and robust algorithmic development.
## Features

- **Length Check:** Evaluates password strength based on its length, awarding higher scores for longer passwords.

- **Complexity Analysis:** Analyzes password complexity by checking for the presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

- **Entropy Calculation:** Utilizes Shannon entropy to measure password randomness, contributing to a more advanced assessment.

- **Dictionary Attack Prevention:** Implements advanced dictionary attack prevention by hashing and comparing against known common passwords.

- **Common Pattern Recognition:** Identifies and penalizes the use of common patterns such as "password" or "123" within the password.

- **Bruteforce Resistance:** Assesses the password's resistance to bruteforce attacks, considering the entire character set.

- **Statistical Bias Evaluation:** Evaluates statistical bias in password character usage, contributing to a more sophisticated analysis.
